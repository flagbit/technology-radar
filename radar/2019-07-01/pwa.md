> Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through
> the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and
> JavaScript. They are intended to work on any platform that uses a
> standards-compliant browser. Functionality includes working offline,
> push notifications, and device hardware access, enabling creating user
> experiences similar to native applications on mobile devices.
> Since they are a type of webpage or website known as a web application, there
> is no requirement for developers or users to install the web apps via digital
> distribution systems like Apple App Store or Google Play.
>
> While web applications have been available for mobile devices for as long as
> mobile devices have existed, they had generally lagged behind native apps in
> terms of speed, features, and user adoption, especially on mobile devices.
> Direct access to hardware and the ability to work offline, previously only
> available to native apps, allows PWAs to perform much faster and to provide
> more features in line with native apps.
>
> PWAs do not require separate bundling or distribution. Publication of a
> progressive web app is as it would be for any other web page. PWAs work in any
> browser, but "app-like" features such as being independent of connectivity,
> install to home screen and push messaging depend on browser support. As of
> April 2018, those features are supported to varying degrees by the
> Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari browsers,
> but more browsers may support the features needed in the future
