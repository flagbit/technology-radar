Writing detailed technical specifications that describe
the suggested implementation for specific requirements.

Used to create more detailed estimates for customer offers,
and to create more flexibility for distributing work
(junior engineers can work on more "difficult" tasks when
they have a detailed specification).

Defines "how" something should be done, as opposed to the "what" (and "why").
